- Hi, I’m Oscar Colwell, a final year undergraduate Mathematics student at Cambridge.
- I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning and Statistical Modelling, using MatLab and R.
- I’m currently learning Python and R.

- I will upload some questions I have been working on which I am allowed to upload (some CATAM projects are not permitted for upload).
